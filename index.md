Over the last hundred years,
researchers have discovered an enormous amount about how people learn
and how best to teach them.
Unfortunately,
much of that knowledge has not yet been translated into common classroom practice,
while many myths about education have proven remarkably persistent.

The class will be hands-on throughout:
short lessons will alternate with individual and group practical exercises,
including practice teaching sessions.
Those who complete the two full days
and [some short follow-up exercises online]({{ page.root }}/checkout/)
will be certified to teach [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }})
and/or [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }}).


*Please fill in [this form][application-form] if you wish to receive Carpentries certification 
and enter "DIBSI Instructor Training" as your Group name.*

*   All participants in this course are required to abide by our [code of conduct][conduct].
*   There are no specific prerequisites for this training,
    but participants will benefit from having been through a Data Carpentry or Software Carpentry workshop
    so that they are familiar with our teaching techniques.
*   In particular, participants are *not* required to have any specific programming skills
    (though of course they should know enough about the subjects of one or more of our lessons
    to be able to teach them).
